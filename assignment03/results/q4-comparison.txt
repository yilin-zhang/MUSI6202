Both spectrograms show the spectral leakage, but it's more obvious in the one using rectangular window.
This effect is due to the fact that the rectangular window has more intense frequency ripples.

2 observations:
1. The frequencies that should show 0 magnitude in the rectangular window one are intensified.
2. Certain harmonics are clearly intensified or diminished in the rectangular window one.
