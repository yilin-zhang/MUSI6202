Question 3.4:
sample rate: 44100 Hz
sample points = sample rate * 0.5 seconds = 22050 points
resolution = sample rate / sample points = 2 Hz/bin

Question 3.5:
The sample rate stays but the number of sample points increases, so the
corresponding value of hertz per bin decreases, which leads to a higher/better
resolution. (I mean the word "resolution" in common sense, not what it is
defined in the previous question.)
